The template contained in this [GitHub](https://github.com) repository is a generic template meeting the most recent [Boise State University](http://www.boisestate.edu) thesis format requirements. If you have questions or run into problems with the format, please email bsulatex@cgiss.boisestate.edu or open an [issue](https://github.com/dylanmikesell/BSU_LaTeX_Thesis_Template/issues).

To run the example LaTeX and build a sample thesis, go to the src/ folder and run 

`$ make`

This will run pdflatex, compile your bibtex, and leave you with a pdf file (BSUmain.pdf). You can open this with any pdf viewer of your choice.
