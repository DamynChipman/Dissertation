% We introduce QAHPS method...

We introduce the quadtree-adaptive Hierarchical Poincar\'e-Steklov (QAHPS) method, an adaptive direct method for solving elliptic partial differential equations on a hierarchy of adaptively refined finite volume meshes. The QAHPS method builds up a solution operator set with $\mathcal{O}(N^{3/2})$ complexity that acts as the factorization of the system matrix, with linear $\mathcal{O}(N)$ complexity for the application of the solution operator set to any number of right-hand side vectors. As the solution operator set is built up by merging local subdomains, it can be adapted as the mesh is refined and coarsened. The method is an adaptive extension to the Hierarchical Poincar\'e-Steklov method by \cite{gillman2014direct}. In this dissertation, we motivate, derive, and analyze the QAHPS method for use with the mesh management library \pforest \citep{burstedde2011p4est}. Through scaling runs on the Polaris supercomputer, we show strong and weak scaling performance. Finally, we apply the QAHPS method to the Laplace, Poisson, and Helmholtz equations, with comparisons to iterative solvers for elliptic partial differential equations.

% An adaptive extension of the Hierarchical Poincar\'e-Steklov (HPS) method \citep{gillman2014direct} is motivated, derived, and analyzed for use in solving elliptic partial differential equations (PDE). The quadtree-adaptive HPS (QAHPS) method is a direct method for use with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) techniques for solving elliptic PDEs on a hierarchy of adaptively refined finite volume meshes.  The QAHPS method is outlined for both serial and parallel computer architectures, with detailed implementation details for use with the mesh library \pforest \citep{burstedde2011p4est}.
