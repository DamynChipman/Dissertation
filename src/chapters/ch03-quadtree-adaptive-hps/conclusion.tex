\section{Conclusion}

This chapter derives the \gls{qahps} method, an adaptive extension of the \gls{hps} method \citep{gillman2014direct} for use with \pforest data structures \citep{burstedde2011p4est}. We outlined the key differences between a binary tree and quadtree structure, as well as the linear algebra associated with a quadtree implementation. Extending the leaf-indexed quadtree to form a path-indexed quadtree allows for efficient storage of the data matrices needed in the \gls{qahps} method.

Our numerical experiments show that the \gls{qahps} method is fast and efficient in terms of time, error, and data storage. We solved three elliptic \gls{pdes} to demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of our method. Indeed, we have shown that the \gls{qahps} method can solve the elliptic problems to similar error with up to $17$ times speedup in the build stage and up to $57$ times speedup in the solve stage. The speedup depends on how well the mesh is able to adapt to the curvature of the solution. Memory use is of particular interest when solving elliptic PDEs with a direct method, and we have demonstrated that this is a highly efficient implementation.
