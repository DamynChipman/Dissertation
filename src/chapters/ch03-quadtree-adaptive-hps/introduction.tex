\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The \gls{qahps} method is a direct method for solving elliptic \gls{pdes} on a hierarchy of adaptively refined finite volume meshes. It builds upon the \gls{hps} methods first presented by \citet{gillman2014direct}, including \gls{amr} considerations found in \citep{babb2018accelerated,geldermans2019adaptive}. The primary contribution of the \gls{qahps} method is the derivation and implementation of the \gls{hps} method for use with a quadtree-style mesh with embedded finite volume meshes. In this chapter, we will derive the \gls{qahps} method, detail the implementation for use with \pforest \citep{burstedde2011p4est,burstedde2020parallel}, and provide a detailed convergence and error analysis for elliptic \gls{pdes}.
