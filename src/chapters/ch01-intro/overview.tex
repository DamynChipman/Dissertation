\section{Overview}

This document will continue as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{\refchap{chap:elliptic-pdes} provides an overview of elliptic PDEs and classical to modern discretization and solution methods. These methods serve as a starting point for more complex methods, and provide for a discussion about the different approaches used in solving the associated linear systems.}
    \item{\refchap{chap:qahps} details the quadtree-adaptive Hierarchical Poincar√©-Steklov (HPS) method that is a primary contribution of this dissertation.}
    \item{\refchap{chap:adaptive-build} highlights the adaptive-rebuild feature of the quadtree-adaptive HPS method, a novel improvement to the existing literature.}
    \item{\refchap{chap:parallel} contains the distributed memory parallel implementation of the quadtree-adaptive HPS method, including a discussion on the challenges and current results.}
    \item{\refchap{chap:applications} provides an assortment of applications of the quadtree-adaptive HPS method, including comparisons with other related codes and methods.}
