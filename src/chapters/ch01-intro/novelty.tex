\section{Novelty of this Work}

The work presented in this dissertation is novel and broadens the field of fast, adaptive, and direct solvers for elliptic PDEs. Largely based on the HPS method of Gillman and Martinsson in \citep{gillman2014direct,martinsson2019fast} and focused on application with codes like \pforest\ \citep{burstedde2011p4est,burstedde2020parallel} and ForestClaw \citep{calhoun2017forestclaw}, this research includes significant contributions to the current literature. Modifying the HPS method for use with quadtree mesh data structures and on finite volume patches, the quadtree-adaptive HPS method that is outlined in \refchap{chap:qahps} and \refchap{chap:adaptive-build} is novel. The parallel implementation outlined in \refchap{chap:parallel} is also novel compared to current shared memory implementations.
