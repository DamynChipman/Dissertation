Elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) arise in many areas of computational sciences such as computational fluid dynamics, biophysics, engineering, geophysics and more. They are difficult to solve due to their global nature and sometimes ill-conditioned operators. We review common discretization methods for elliptic PDEs such as the finite difference, finite volume, finite element, and spectral methods and the linear systems they form. We also provide an overview of classic to modern solution methods for the linear systems formed by these discretization methods. These methods include splitting and Krylov methods, direct methods, and hierarchical methods. Finally, we show applications that would benefit from fast and efficient solvers for elliptic PDEs, including projection methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the shallow water wave equations with dispersive corrections.
