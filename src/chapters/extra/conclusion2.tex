\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The discretization of elliptic partial differential equations leads to linear systems that can be solved with efficient solvers, taking advantage of the structure of the problem. Discretization methods include the finite difference method, finite volume method, finite element method, spectral methods, and more. These discretizations lead to linear systems of the standard form $\textbf{A} \textbf{u} = \textbf{f}$, where $\textbf{A}$ is sparse and structured. Efficient methods such as splitting and Krylov methods, matrix factorizations, and hierarchical domain decomposition methods can take advantage of the structure of the linear system. These solution methods can also be expanded upon in order to achieve near linear performance and are well suited for high-performance applications.

In addition, we presented various areas of study that could greatly benefit from an efficient, fast, and scalable solver for elliptic PDEs. This includes many applications in computational fluid dynamics like the incompressible Navier-Stokes and the shallow water wave equations. Using projection methods for the Navier-Stokes equations and the Serre-Green-Naghdi dispersive model leads to elliptic terms that must be solved at each time step. Fast, direct methods like the ones currently being studied and implemented can accelerate these areas as well as any area that solves an elliptic partial differential equation.
