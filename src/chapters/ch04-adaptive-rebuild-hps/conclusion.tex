\section{Conclusion}

This chapter outlines the adaptive-rebuild feature of the \gls{qahps} method. The factorization is represented as a set of locally merged solution operators and so any changes to the mesh can be efficiently incorporated into the factorization set. When a node is refined or coarsened, the solution operators of all ancestors must be updated. Doing so uses the same 4-to-1 merge as the \gls{qahps} method, but only on a per-level basis. After the initial mesh and factorization is computed, a full build is no longer needed; rather, the updates to the factorization can be done during refinement or coarsening. We have shown through convergence and timing numerical experiments that this approach leads to a significant decrease in the time to solution for subsequent solves, while still obtaining the same $2^{nd}$ order solution as the full \gls{qahps} method.
