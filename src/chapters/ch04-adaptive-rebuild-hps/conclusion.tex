\section{Conclusion}

This chapter outlines the adaptive-rebuild feature of the \gls{qahps} method. As the factorization is represented as a set of locally merged solution operators, any changes to the mesh can be efficiently incorporated into the factorization set. When a node is refined or coarsened, the ancestors of the tagged node must also be updated. Doing so uses the same 4-to-1 merge as the \gls{qahps} method, but only on a per-level basis. After the initial mesh and factorization is computed, the build stage no longer needs to be called for each solve. Rather the updates to the factorization can be done during refinement or coarsening. We have shown through convergence and timing numerical experiments that this approach leads to a significant decrease in the time to solution for subsequent solves, while still obtaining the same $2^{nd}$ order solution as the full \gls{qahps} method.
