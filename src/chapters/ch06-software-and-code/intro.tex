\section{Introduction}

Having detailed the algorithms associated with the \gls{qahps} method, this chapter is dedicated to the software that implements the \gls{qahps} method. The code developed as part of this research is found in the EllipticForest repository \citep{chipman2024ellipticforest}. The software has been highlighted in the paper {\em EllipticForest: A Direct Solver Library for Elliptic Partial Differential Equations on Adaptive Meshes} published in the Journal of Open Source Software. This paper has been reproduced in \refapdx{apdx:elliptic-forest}.

In addition, we examine three case studies of elliptic \gls{pdes} and solve them with different direct and iterative methods. The goal of this study is to compare the \gls{qahps} method to other codes and solvers commonly used to solve elliptic \gls{pdes}. We will look at the ThunderEgg \citep{aiton2022thunderegg} code as coupled with the ForestClaw \citep{calhoun2017forestclaw} software library, as well as the PETSc \citep{anl2023petsc} software library.
