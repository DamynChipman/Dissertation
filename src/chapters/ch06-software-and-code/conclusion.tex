\section{Conclusion}

The software implementation of the \gls{qahps} method is highlighted in this chapter. EllipticForest is an object-oriented software library ready for extension and integration into application codes.

The case studies presented in this chapter compare common iterative solvers to the direct \gls{qahps} solver as implemented in EllipticForest. This includes with PETSc's \gls{cg}, \gls{gmres}, and \gls{bcgs} for uniform cases and ThunderEgg's multigrid solvers for adaptive cases. The case studies target elliptic \gls{pdes} that arise in physics and engineering modeling, such as the variable coefficient Poisson equation and the high wave number Helmholtz equation.

Furthermore, the case studies show that the adaptive and uniform implementations of the \gls{qahps} method found in EllipticForest are competitive with iterative solvers commonly used in research and development codes. This includes the full \gls{qahps} method (build, upwards, and solve stages). After the initial factorization is computed, subsequent direct solves would be orders of magnitude faster than subsequent iterative solves.
