Boise, 09/27/06, KvW:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's a template for BSU graduate theses. If you find
problems with it, please e-mail me at kasper@cgiss.boisestate.edu. If
you used the template successfully, please shoot me a message, so that
I can keep track.

This directory should be pretty self-contained, with the style files
and such. If you miss packages in your installation of latex, go to:
http://www.ctan.org/
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's how you create output of the template. Run on command line:

> pdflatex BSUmain

(to create a pdf file of the thesis. If you don't have pdflatex, you 
can also run latex, then convert the dvi output file with dvipdf or 
something)

> bibtex BSUmain

(to envoke the references - natbib.pdf teaches you the features of the
natbib package for bibtex.)

- IMPORTANT: repeat both commands until references are updated. (latex
will tell you when it was fully successful in generating BSUmain.pdf)

> kpdf BSUmain.pdf 

(to view. You can use your favorite pdf viewer)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT THE GRAPHICS

\includegraphics understand figures in postscript (.ps, .eps) format,
	or pdf format (.pdf). I strongly recommend using all pdf.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT THE MARGINS
	
There is a testpage.tex that comes with your isntallation of
latex. Compile it and print the output to see if your configuration is
correct for your printer. If not, please contact your system
administrator. LaTeX assumes a4 papersize out of the box!!

CHANGES:

- 02/26/07: split the MS and PhD thesis format: the MS degree does not
have an external member. Not quite pleasing this way: I'm waiting for
the first person with a co-advisor to write me: right now, that option
is commented out in both formats.
- 11/19/07: made numerous changes to conform with the wishes of the 
graduate college. Also, merged PhD and MS style files again. The only 
reason for the split was the title page, and this still requires hacking.
Come see me if you cannot figure this out yourself.
- 11/28/07: added a heading called "APPENDICES" in TOC. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO DO:

- fix the hyperlink stuff
- automate the title page for all its different options (MS, PhD, external 
members, co-advisors, etc.)
- fix hyphenation for long section and subsection headings
